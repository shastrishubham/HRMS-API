Hi Sir,
January-2020 we purchased a flat in A3-1301 which is possession on June-2020 but due to covid pandemic possession was delay and unfortunately I lose my job and there is one property of mine at my hometown which i need to sell but those dealing are also cancel due to covid pandemic.and that's why we spoke to Shila mam please try to give some discount and if it's not possible then we are ready to cancel our dealing for A3-1301.but Shilpa mam said that you need to ask Jayprasad sir and we talked to Jayprasad sir and he said that I'll discuss with Goyal sir and let you know. Then after 4-5 days he called me to say we give 1 Lakhs discount please don't cancel the deal.So we came in Last week of July for Registry. At that time they said we are giving you 1 Lakhs Credit Note at the last Installment. and we already purchased 3 flats for my relatives that's why we are not asking for any written. and we do the Registry for the flat.Now it's time to Last installment and when I saw the demand letter it seems that there is no 1 Lakhs Credit note. So we called Shilpa mam but she didn't receive our calls so we came to the Camp office on 27th August.and then I realized that Shilpa mam and Jayprasad sir left the Goal Ganga group.So what should i do in such a situation and lastly dealing with my relatives we are very clear about the payments and we do it very clearly but in my situation I lose my job due to covid and you committed to us that's why we are doing the Registry and pay the remaining payments. and sir commitment is commitment only.So I kindly request that you understand my situation and you have already commitmented to us. That's why I'm bothering you.
